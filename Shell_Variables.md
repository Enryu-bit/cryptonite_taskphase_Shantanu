# Shell Variables
## Printing Variables
Learnt about the `echo` command which is used to print out stuff on screen.<br>
It can also print variables by using `$` before their name.<br>
In this challenge the flag was in the variable named `FLAG` and I had to print it out using `echo` command.<br>
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{cbHm-VwdsuS4mYzQeUwaMFd2_RI.ddTN1QDLzYTN0czW}
```
