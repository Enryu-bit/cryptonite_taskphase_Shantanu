# Pondering Paths
## The root
learnt about the tree filesystem in linux. <br>
learnt about what a root(directory) is and how it can contain multiple directories inside it. <br>
the address of the directory is path. <br>
By looking at the path we could trace back to the root. <br>
invoked `/pwn` program to get the flag. <br>
command - `/pwn` <br>
## Program And Absolute Paths
earlier I learnt theory about what directories are, in this challenge I had to access a program by using its path to get the flag <br>
command- `/challenge/run`
